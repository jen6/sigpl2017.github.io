### CoqIde Shortkeys

- `Ctrl + Alt + Down` : Prove next statement
- `Ctrl + Alt + Right` : Prove up to the cursor
- `Ctrl + Alt + Up` : Retreat by one statement

### Troubleshootings

- If you are using Windows OS, and if `Ctrl + Alt + Arrow` rotates the screen, you can try either of two solutions :
    + Change shortkeys by opening `Preferences` -> `Shortcuts` in CoqIde.
    + Disable screen rotation functionality in Windows by opening Intel HD utility (try `Ctrl + Alt + F12`). [link](http://superuser.com/questions/592684/disable-screen-orientation-hot-keys-in-windows-8-ctrl-alt-arrow)
