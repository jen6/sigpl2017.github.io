    + If not, your submissions (assignments & exams) will not be properly graded.

- Install Coq.
    + Installer (OS X / Windows)
        * Download [Binaries](https://coq.inria.fr/download) and install it.

        * Install necessary libraries.
            - OS X

                    # install brew (http://brew.sh/index.html)
                    brew install gtksourceview libxml2

            - CentOS-like Linux

                    sudo yum install gtksourceview2-devel
